# Basic Flutter Apps

This repository contains a couple of apps I developed using Flutter, an open source UI software development kit by Google, connected to a firebase database (for one of the apps, Brew Crew). These projects were a part of my process to learn the framework and basics of Flutter, such as using packages, APIs, UI design, database management, etc.


## The projects:
### World Time
This is a simple and very basic app that reports the current time of a few selected cities around the world. It makes an http request to a World Time API as an when the city name is clicked/tapped on. The UI presented is also pretty straightforward, with a list of cities presented as a menu and time and city name displayed, with a background indicating day/night, as selected.

### Brew Crew
This app serves a very basic principle and provides a decent understanding of authorization and database management using the Firebase client, for a Flutter app. The function of the app is that each member of a team can add their coffee requirements to their profile, which is then stored in a common database for a particular team and then any member of the team can check that up. The purpose is to save collective time spent by each team member brewing their own coffee, leading to intermittent breaks during work hours; instead one member could look up the requirements for other colleagues and get coffee for others. This projects entails email authorization, firebase management, and multiple screen UI.
